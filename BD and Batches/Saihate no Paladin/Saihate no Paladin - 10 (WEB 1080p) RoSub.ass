Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.85,0:02:47.38,Main,Will,0,0,0,,I have received a part of that flame \Nfrom Gracefeel, the goddess of light.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.01,0:02:49.68,Main,Will,0,0,0,,I believe the ones who carry that flame
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.68,0:02:53.46,Main,Will,0,0,0,,are the ones who should march \Nfirst into the darkness.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.11,0:02:56.70,Main,Will,0,0,0,,They must shine the light upon \Nthose who lament in darkness,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.70,0:02:59.29,Main,Will,0,0,0,,and light the path for \Nthose who follow behind.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.60,0:03:04.78,Main,Will,0,0,0,,So please, I beg of you.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.78,0:03:08.98,Main,Will,0,0,0,,Can you somehow grant permission \Nfor this undertaking of mine?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.97,0:03:17.96,Main,Ethelbald,0,0,0,,William, this path will \Nonly lead to despair.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.28,0:03:46.04,Main,Ethelbald,0,0,0,,Come to think of it, you are \Na high priest, aren't you?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.04,0:03:48.37,Main,Ethelbald,0,0,0,,And you have quite a good friend, too.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.66,0:03:55.56,Main,Ethelbald,0,0,0,,When I said I was going to kill you,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.56,0:03:59.95,Main,Ethelbald,0,0,0,,that half-elf there gave me \Nquite the murderous glare.

Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.21,0:04:04.64,Main,Menel,0,0,0,,I was just steeling myself 'cause \NI figured you'd kill me, too.

Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.65,0:04:31.47,Main,Bagley,0,0,0,,This young man is registered \Nwith my temple!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.47,0:04:34.62,Main,Bagley,0,0,0,,Though it may be temporary, \Nhe is a member of the temple!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.62,0:04:37.26,Main,Bagley,0,0,0,,And you beckon him here \Nwithout a word to me?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.26,0:04:40.11,Main,Bagley,0,0,0,,Do you mean to disregard \Nthe temple's authority?!

Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.15,0:04:51.72,Main,Bagley,0,0,0,,You cannot forego verification \Nprotocol simply because I was away!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.72,0:04:56.70,Main,Ethelbald,0,0,0,,So you say, but the people from your \Ntemple seemed happy to send him to me.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.70,0:04:59.10,Main,Bagley,0,0,0,,Hmph! A total lack of discipline!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.10,0:05:01.48,Main,Bagley,0,0,0,,I will give them a stern talking-to later!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.48,0:05:02.52,Main,Bagley,0,0,0,,In any case, he—
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.52,0:05:05.15,Main,Ethelbald,0,0,0,,The thing is, Bishop Bagley...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.15,0:05:07.30,Main,Ethelbald,0,0,0,,He is not what you think he is.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.30,0:05:08.41,Main,Bagley,0,0,0,,Huh?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.41,0:05:11.61,Main,Ethelbald,0,0,0,,He came here asking me to \Nassemble a private army.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.61,0:05:14.97,Main,Ethelbald,0,0,0,,Says he wants to save the \Npoor people of Beast Woods.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.99,0:05:22.76,Main,Ethelbald,0,0,0,,I would be lying if I said it never \Ncrossed my mind to kill him right here.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.04,0:05:25.41,Main,Ethelbald,0,0,0,,But he's just so frank.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.41,0:05:28.09,Main,Ethelbald,0,0,0,,Somehow, I started to \Nfind it quite amusing.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.75,0:05:29.99,Main,Ethelbald,0,0,0,,Which is why...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.81,0:05:34.90,Main,Ethelbald,0,0,0,,I'm thinking of appointing him as a knight.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.90,0:05:37.93,Main,Ethelbald,0,0,0,,Would your temple give him its blessing?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.69,0:05:42.49,Main,Ethelbald,0,0,0,,You know, a paladin.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.95,0:05:46.41,Main,Ethelbald,0,0,0,,The temple and I will share the \Nresponsibility and the profits equally.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.41,0:05:48.23,Main,Ethelbald,0,0,0,,What do you say?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.23,0:05:49.65,Main,Bagley,0,0,0,,What?!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.65,0:05:53.34,Main,Ethelbald,0,0,0,,He would, of course, \Nfall under our joint authority.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.34,0:05:55.90,Main,Ethelbald,0,0,0,,If it comes to it, you could always \Nhave him excommunicated.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.90,0:05:58.40,Main,Bagley,0,0,0,,Th-Th-That is not the issue here!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.40,0:06:01.16,Main,Ethelbald,0,0,0,,The temple can attest to his character,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.16,0:06:05.81,Main,Ethelbald,0,0,0,,and as the Wyvern Killer, he should \Nhave no problems with the rest.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.81,0:06:07.55,Main,Bagley,0,0,0,,This is proceeding too quickly!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.78,0:06:11.58,Main,Bagley,0,0,0,,I will return to the temple and think it over! \NIs that acceptable?!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.58,0:06:12.48,Main,Ethelbald,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.02,0:06:17.15,Main,Ethelbald,0,0,0,,But it would make me truly happy \Nto see this happen, Bagley.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.15,0:06:19.94,Main,Ethelbald,0,0,0,,I've taken a liking to this young man.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.94,0:06:22.62,Main,Bagley,0,0,0,,Assuming I do become his patron,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.62,0:06:24.62,Main,Bagley,0,0,0,,spare me your silly games!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.09,0:06:27.79,Main,Bagley,0,0,0,,You, novice boy! We're leaving!

Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.23,0:06:42.01,Main,Menel,0,0,0,,What's that old geezer's deal?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.01,0:06:43.99,Main,Will,0,0,0,,Uh, Menel, he's...
