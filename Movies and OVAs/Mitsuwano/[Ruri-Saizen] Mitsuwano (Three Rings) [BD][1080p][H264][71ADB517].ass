Dialogue: 10,0:00:22.66,0:00:24.70,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes, Mother.{the manager of these geiko (geisha of kyoto) establishments are known as "okami" and are called "okaasan" (mom) by the workers because she's the mother figure. "Mom" sounds too weird}{Well, it works but the slight drawback is the older women in brothels are called madams, so it may give off the wrong impression. But then, there isn't a phrase that doesn't sound awkward; Matron sounds like they're in a hospital (though it was used in oldskool boarding schools too - and the etymology of the word comes from mater, the latin word for mother) and you've outlined the strangeness of Mother already (though I have heard it used in similar contexts)}{Okay, so coming back to this (and good luck following everything, Kuro), I've decided that this environment is meant to be seen as a family so the fact that they call her Mother and the older geisha 'Onee-san' should be reflected in our English version. It may sound weird but I think it might be needed symbolically for the message of this anime}
